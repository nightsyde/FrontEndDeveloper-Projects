                                Well, I have reworked the site and included most of what I missed before. I had to rename some of my style classes, because naming something "card" instead of "post" seems to be important, even if they
                                functioned the same way. I also did some content update, because the psuedo-dummy stuff I was using was just not long enough to show the formting requirements for the page.
                            </p>
                            <p>I am still confused about one comment the reviewer had:</p>
                            <blockquote><li>You have made separate pages for Authors info and social sharing, this should be on the blog page.</li></blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Okay, so I have a separate page for "Author Info", instead of having it plastered on the front page. I suppose I can shoehorn that at the bottom, just above the footer. I'm not sure about the
                                <u>"social sharing"</u>, though. I am guessing that they are talking about the subscription form.
