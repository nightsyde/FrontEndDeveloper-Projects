                            <p>
                                Well, I have reworked the site and included most of what I missed before. I had to rename some of my style classes, because naming something "card" instead of "post" seems to be important, even if they
                                functioned the same way. I also did some content update, because the psuedo-dummy stuff I was using was just not long enough to show the formting requirements for the page.
                            </p>
                            <p>I am still confused about one comment the reviewer had:</p>
                            <blockquote><li>You have made separate pages for Authors info and social sharing, this should be on the blog page.</li></blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Okay, so I have a separate page for "Author Info", instead of having it plastered on the front page. I suppose I can shoehorn that at the bottom, just above the footer. I'm not sure about the
                                <u>"social sharing"</u>, though. I am guessing that they are talking about the subscription form.

                                Technically, it was the second review. The <strong>actual</strong> first reply was that the reviewer couldn't see the files. I had not set up my Git Pages properly, so I had to do a quick review of that, then
                                redo my file structure to post the project. <em>Then</em> I got my review.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There were some requirements I missed, like using bold and italic text, having alt text for images that I had also forgotten to include, and doing style sheet imports. It is too late in the day for me to feel
                                like messing with it right now, so I will tackle it all again tomorrow.

                                Yay! I got the first draft of my website completed and submitted. I had a little issue with responsiveness with Chrome until I figured out that I had to enable "Experimental Features" in order for it to
                                properly read the style changes with changing screen widths. I fought with the code for a couple hours before I tried it on Firefox and realized that it was browser issue. Then I spent another hour figuring
                                out why. Still, the pages are working and uploaded.

                                Part of the rubric talks about how to format the commentary for updates to the file repositories on Github. Some of the stuff they specify makes sense. The problem is that my mind doesn't work in the same
                                boxes theirs apparently do, particularly when it comes to the types of updates I make. If I'm doing near-wholesale changes to the content of my <em>webpage</em>, it is <strong>NOT</strong> a "feature". When I
                                upload new stylesheets, or changes to the styles, how am I supposed to categorize it? Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, over?

                                I started reading over the rubric for this project. I don't think I have seen more extraneous requirements and silliness than the list of items that <strong>have</strong> to be included in the page. Not to
                                mention that a good portion of what is in the requirements list was not covered during the course content. Okay, I understand that part of the process is to have the students learn to look the information up
                                themselves. Still, having to look up the syntax for some of this is annoying.
